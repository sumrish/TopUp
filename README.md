This is an android mobile application project developed using JAVA as programming language and MVVM architecture, Dagger dependency injection, and observable and singleton design patterns. The frontend is implemented using ConstraintLayout for layout management.

## Project Overview
The mobile application is designed to help beginners with Dagger. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and allows for easier testing and maintainability.

The project utilizes Dagger for dependency injection, enabling efficient management and instantiation of dependencies. This helps to decouple components and improve modularity and scalability.

Observable and Singleton design patterns are used to handle data flow and ensure data consistency throughout the application. Observables allow for easy communication between components, while singletons ensure that only a single instance of a class exists throughout the application's lifecycle.

The frontend of the application is built using ConstraintLayout, a powerful layout manager that provides flexibility and responsiveness to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure, organized into the following directories:

app: Contains the main application module and entry point.
data: Contains data-related classes such as repositories, data models, and API clients.
di: Contains Dagger-related classes and modules for dependency injection.
ui: Contains user interface components such as activities, fragments, and adapters.
utils: Contains utility classes and helper functions.
